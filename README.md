# üìò Data Structures & Algorithms in Java



Welcome to my personal repository for practicing and mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** using Java. This project serves as a comprehensive collection of code, notes, and solutions aimed at strengthening problem-solving skills for coding interviews and competitive programming.

---

## üéØ Core Objectives

* üìñ **Revise Fundamentals:** Solidify core DSA concepts from the ground up.
* üí° **Practice Problems:** Solve a wide range of questions from platforms like LeetCode, GeeksforGeeks, and HackerRank.
* üèÜ **Strengthen Skills:** Enhance problem-solving abilities and code optimization techniques for competitive programming and technical interviews.
